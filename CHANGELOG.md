## [7.0.1] - 2021-05-07

- When fetching the idRefreshToken from the frontend, if the backend is not working, we assume that the session doesn't exist.

## [7.0.0] - 2021-05-01

### Changed:

- Uses frontend set cookies instead of localstorage so that sub domain session works on Safari
- Sends `rid` on each request - acts as a CSRF protection measure (see https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#use-of-custom-request-headers)
